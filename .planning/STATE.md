# Project State

## Current Session
- **Working on**: Reframing site structure
- **Last completed**: Design section outline (in /project management/)
- **Blocked by**: Nothing

## Key Decisions Made This Session
- Overview = pitch (what Active:Archive is, why it matters)
- Shop/Design/Sell = interactive demos, not more pitching
- Shop: consumer experience demo (browse → measure → checkout)
- Design: brand tool demo (upload pattern → convert → iterate → combine)
- Sell: brand dashboard demo (archive view → sales → orders → production)
- Order likely: Shop → Design → Sell (or Design → Sell → Shop if brand-first)

## Next Steps
- Rewrite Design section as interactive demo spec, not pitch page
- Create similar specs for Shop and Sell sections
- Overview needs the "Why Now" urgency + hard stats

## Key Decisions
- Site is for Active:Archive (initiative), not One to One (company)
- One to One tech powers the experience but isn't the hero
- Password protected
- Targeting: brand partners, collaborators, potential investors

## Tech Stack
- Deployed on Vercel
- GitHub repo: OTOJulian/active-archive-site_002
- Static site (no backend needed initially)

## Session History
- [Date]: Initial site structure, password gate, hero
- [Date]: Core sections (Concept, Process, Technology, Moment)

## Open Questions
- What specifically goes in Projects section? Case studies vs archive pieces?
- Team headshots ready?
- Fit visualization screenshots available?

## Deferred Items
- See ISSUES.md
