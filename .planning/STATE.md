# Project State

## Current Session
- **Working on**: Design system polish and accessibility
- **Last completed**: Full accessibility audit + design system refactor
- **Blocked by**: Nothing

## Key Decisions Made This Session
- Extracted shared `<PageNav />` component for Shop/Sell/Design pages
- Created unified button system (`.btn`, `.btn--primary`, `.btn--secondary`, `.btn--text`)
- Added skip link for keyboard navigation
- Added `prefers-reduced-motion` support globally
- Hero nav intentionally different from page nav (immersive landing UX)

## Previous Session Decisions (Preserved)
- Overview = pitch (what Active:Archive is, why it matters)
- Shop/Design/Sell = interactive demos, not more pitching
- Shop: consumer experience demo (browse → measure → checkout)
- Design: brand tool demo (upload pattern → convert → iterate → combine)
- Sell: brand dashboard demo (archive view → sales → orders → production)

## Next Steps
- Rewrite Design section as interactive demo spec, not pitch page
- Create similar specs for Shop and Sell sections
- Overview needs the "Why Now" urgency + hard stats

## Key Decisions
- Site is for Active:Archive (initiative), not One to One (company)
- One to One tech powers the experience but isn't the hero
- Password protected
- Targeting: brand partners, collaborators, potential investors

## Tech Stack
- Deployed on Vercel
- GitHub repo: OTOJulian/active-archive-site_002
- Static site (no backend needed initially)

## Session History
- [Date]: Initial site structure, password gate, hero
- [Date]: Core sections (Concept, Process, Technology, Moment)
- 2026-01-18: Accessibility audit (RAMS + Web Interface Guidelines), design system refactor

## Open Questions
- What specifically goes in Projects section? Case studies vs archive pieces?
- Team headshots ready?
- Fit visualization screenshots available?

## Deferred Items
- See ISSUES.md
