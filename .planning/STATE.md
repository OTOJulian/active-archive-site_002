# Project State

## Current Session
- **Working on**: Phase 3 - Team & Contact sections
- **Last completed**: Phase 2 - Core sections
- **Blocked by**: Nothing

## Key Decisions
- Site is for Active:Archive (initiative), not One to One (company)
- One to One tech powers the experience but isn't the hero
- Password protected
- Targeting: brand partners, collaborators, potential investors

## Tech Stack
- Deployed on Vercel
- GitHub repo: OTOJulian/active-archive-site_002
- Static site (no backend needed initially)

## Session History
- [Date]: Initial site structure, password gate, hero
- [Date]: Core sections (Concept, Process, Technology, Moment)

## Open Questions
- What specifically goes in Projects section? Case studies vs archive pieces?
- Team headshots ready?
- Fit visualization screenshots available?

## Deferred Items
- See ISSUES.md
