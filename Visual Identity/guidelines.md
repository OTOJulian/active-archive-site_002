> **In Pursuit of the Total Image**

Content & Marketing Studio | Headquartered in New York City

---

## Brand Overview

ONE to ONE is a content and marketing studio that pursues the "Total Image" — a philosophy rooted in completeness, unity, and perfection. The brand identity reflects this through the conceptual fusion of a perfect circle (representing totality) with the letter "O" from the serif typeface Century Schoolbook.

### Brand Values
- Totality and completeness
- Precision and intentionality
- Classic elegance with modern sensibility
- Attention to craft and detail

---

## 1. Logo System

### 1.1 Primary Logotype
The primary logo reads **ONE to ONE** set horizontally. The word "ONE" appears in all caps using Century Schoolbook Regular, while "to" is set in lowercase italic.

**Construction Notes:**
- The letter "O" in both instances of "ONE" is constructed from the fusion of a perfect circle and the typographic "O"
- This creates the distinctive brand mark within the wordmark itself

**Usage:**
- Preferred for most applications
- Works on both light and dark backgrounds
- Can be placed over photography when sufficient contrast exists

### 1.2 Numerical Logo
An alternative expression: **1 : 1**
- Uses the numeral "1" from Century Schoolbook
- Colon separator uses two vertically stacked dots
- Used for compact applications or as a shorthand reference

### 1.3 Stacked Logotype
```
ONE
 to
ONE
```
- Vertical arrangement for portrait-oriented formats
- "to" is centered and set in lowercase italic
- Each "ONE" is aligned to create visual balance

### 1.4 Icon Logo
The icon is formed by overlaying a perfect circle with the letter "O", creating a distinctive mark that suggests infinity, unity, and totality.

**Use cases:**
- Favicons
- Social media profile images
- App icons
- Small-scale applications

---

## 2. Logo Safe Space & Sizing

### Safe Space
A protected safe space determined by the width/height of the letter "O" designates the absolute minimum zone in which no other graphic element may appear. This also indicates how close the logo can be to the edge of a page.

### Recommended Sizing
Consistent logo sizing across all mediums and platforms is essential:

**Landscape formats:**
- Sizing A: Logo repeated ×3 flush with edge
- Sizing B: Logo repeated ×5 flush with edge

**Portrait formats:**
- Three different sizing techniques available
- Achieved by multiplying the logo and placing it flush with the edge of the document

## 3. Color Palette

### Primary Colors

| Color Name | Hex | RGB | Usage |
|------------|-----|-----|-------|
| **Charcoal Black** | `#333333` | 51, 51, 51 | Primary brand color, dark backgrounds, logo on light |
| **Pure White** | `#FFFFFF` | 255, 255, 255 | Logo on dark, backgrounds, negative space |
| **Off-White / Cream** | `#F5F5F0` | 245, 245, 240 | Secondary backgrounds, print applications |

### Color Application
- The brand operates primarily in a monochromatic palette
- High contrast between black and white is essential
- Photography provides color variation while brand elements remain neutral
- Never apply color to the logo or typography

## 5. Graphic Element

### 5.1 Overview
The Graphic Element comes from the circles in the colon of the numerical logo (1:1), duplicated and used as a device to frame compositions and overlay over images.

### 5.2 Orientations
The Graphic Element has two orientations:

**Orientation A:** Four dots at each corner of a rectangular frame
**Orientation B:** Three dots in a triangular arrangement (one top center, two bottom corners, or inverted)

### 5.3 Margins & Positioning
- The margin system is based on 1/28th the height of the document
- Each circle should be placed at each corner against the inside of the margins
- Formula: X = H/28 (where H = document height)

### 5.4 Scale
- The size of the circles is determined as 1/42th of the height of the document
- Circle diameter = H/42
- Follow this technique to keep sizing consistent across all mediums
