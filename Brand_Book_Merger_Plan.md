## Estimated Final Document

- **Unique Value**: Bridges strategic brand theory with manufacturing reality — rare in brand book guides

---

## Questions Before Proceeding

1. **Depth preference**: Should this remain an outline/framework (what to include) or become a filled-in example brand book for a fictional brand?

2. **Visual examples**: Should I include placeholder descriptions for diagrams/images, or source actual visual examples?

3. **Citation style**: Keep Option 1's numbered endnotes, or switch to inline hyperlinks for digital use?

4. **New content priority**: Which of the "new additions" are most important to develop fully vs. leave as placeholders?

5. **Final format**: Word document (.docx), PDF, or both?
